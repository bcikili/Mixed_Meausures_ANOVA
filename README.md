# Mixed_Meausures_ANOVA
Using 'suicide' dataset we determine whether suicide rates (suicides/100k pop) has changed over the years (year), and see if the generation has any influence. To do so, we use a mixed measures ANOVA, since there is both a repeated time element and a between subjects element.
